# Summary

DR Daily is a news aggregator site that uses the NewsAPI to show all news
articles that reference the Dominican Republic. It's mostly been made to show my
ability to use React, JavaScript, & TailwindCSS. It uses Radix components for
the Dialog & theme toggle.


Unfortunately I can't deploy it because the NewsAPI free tier only covers 100 requests per monthðŸ™ƒ.
