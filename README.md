# Summary
DR Daily is a news aggregator site that uses the NewsAPI to show all news articles that reference
the Dominican Republic. 
It's mostly been made to show my ability to use React, JavaScript, & TailwindCSS.
It uses Radix components for the Dialog & theme toggle.

### Note
This project was inspired by the DR Daily Android app I built before and was small hence the single commit. It did take more time than the single commit may show.
